## Features

* SYS Calls
	* `yield` - ends the current time slice.
	* `write` - writes to an open file descriptor.
	* `read`  - reads from an file descriptor. Returns length of read, 0 on EOF. Blocking.
	* `close` - closes a file descriptor.
	* `dup2`  - duplicates fd from `old` to `new`. `new` is closed if it already exists.
	* `pipe`  - creates a pipe. fd[0] is read, fd[1] is write.
	* `fork`  - clones process. Return value is 0 if child, PID of child if parent, -1 if error.
	* `exec`  - replaces the process with another program. PID is kept. Stack and FDs are destroyed.
	* `exit`  - exits with exit code.
	* `wait`  - waits for a child program to exit, and gives exit code.
* Multi-processing
	* **time slicing** - timer based timer slices.
	* **priority-based** - priority(P) = priority_base(P) + slices_since_last_ran(P)
	* **blocked queue** - for processes waiting for a process or file resource.
* Objects
	* `FiDes` - File descriptor. Interacted with using function pointers.
	* `pipe`  - Pointed to by a FD.
